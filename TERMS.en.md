Preface

Welcome to “牛马神器”! The “牛马神器” software and related services (the “Platform”) refer to the services provided by 覃不自经AGI and/or its affiliates (“我们”) via websites, plugins, applications (which may include different versions), SDKs, APIs, and other forms enabled by technological development.

We may cooperate with qualified third‑party service providers to deliver parts of the Service, and such providers may charge fees. Before using those services, you should read and agree to the applicable special terms. If you use a third‑party paid service, any disputes arising therefrom shall be governed by the relevant special terms and agreements between you and that provider.

This User Agreement is an agreement between you and us regarding your registration, login and use of the Service. It governs your access to and use of our websites, applications, products, third‑party services, software, tools, content and documents (collectively, the “Service”).

You may use the Service to write software applications, scripts and other code‑based products.

Please read and fully understand this Agreement before using the Service, especially clauses that exempt or limit liability, grant rights, and set governing law or dispute resolution. Important clauses are highlighted in bold. If you do not agree, please stop using the Service.

By choosing to use the Service, you are deemed to have fully understood and accepted this Agreement and other related rules (including but not limited to the Privacy Policy and algorithm description). We may publish additional rules, policies, guidelines and procedures from time to time, which form part of this Agreement.

If you have any questions, please contact us.

To improve experience, security and services, we may update or change part or all of the Service from time to time. We may notify you in an appropriate manner where feasible.

You may stop using the Service at any time. We may also suspend or terminate the Service, or add restrictions at any time.

You must prepare the necessary devices and network connectivity at your own cost. Accessing the Service from your device is deemed your use of the Service.

Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Service, you confirm that you have the capacity to enter into a contract with 覃不自经AGI and agree to be bound by this Agreement.

If you act on behalf of an entity, “you” includes that entity. You represent that you are authorized to bind the entity, and the entity is responsible for all use under your account.

Changes to These Terms

We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. We may notify you of material changes through the Platform and will update the “Last Updated” date. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service.

Your Account

4.1 We provide registration channels. You may register using a mobile phone number or other methods we allow. You may also log in through third‑party accounts where permitted. The verification code you receive is a credential to access the Service.

4.2 If you wish to close your account, contact us at 1870511741@qq.com. After reasonable verification, we will assist you to close the account and delete related information unless otherwise required by law. Closed accounts cannot be reactivated.

4.3 Your account information (name, avatar, profile, etc.) must comply with laws and our rules. It must not contain illegal or harmful content, impersonation or misleading information. We may review and reject non‑compliant information.

4.4 Your account is for your own use only. Without our written consent, you may not gift, lend, rent, transfer or sell it. If we reasonably believe the user is not the original registrant, we may suspend or terminate the account to protect security.

4.5 Keep your password and verification codes secure. Do not disclose them to others. If you discover unauthorized use or security issues, notify us immediately. All actions performed through your account are deemed your actions.
