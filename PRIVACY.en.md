1.1 Registration and login

a) When you register or log in, you may create an account using your phone number. This is required by law for real‑name registration. If you do not provide it, certain features may not be available.

(4) When you interact with the AI assistant, we receive your inputs and generate outputs. If you enable code knowledge graph features, we may upload code for embedding computation to build an index.
